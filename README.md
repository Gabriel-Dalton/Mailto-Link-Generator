# Mailto Link Generator

## Overview

The **Mailto Link Generator** is a simple but powerful web tool designed to help developers, content creators, and anyone working with HTML. This tool automatically converts plain email addresses within a block of HTML code into `mailto` links, which can be clicked to open the user's default email client.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Conversion**: As soon as you paste your HTML code containing an email address into the tool, it automatically finds the email address and wraps it in a `mailto` link.
- **Preserves HTML Structure**: The tool ensures that your existing HTML, including all tags, classes, and attributes, remains intact. Only the email addresses are modified.
- **Auto Copy to Clipboard**: After processing the HTML, the updated code is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy pasting back into your project.
- **No Button Click Required**: The tool starts working immediately when you paste your HTML code, making the process seamless and efficient.

### How It Works

1. **Paste Your Code**: Paste any block of HTML containing an email address into the tool's textarea.
2. **Automatic Processing**: The tool immediately detects the email address and converts it into a clickable `mailto` link.
3. **Clipboard Copy**: The processed HTML code is automatically copied to your clipboard, and a confirmation message is displayed.
4. **Use the Output**: Simply paste the updated HTML back into your project.

### Why This Tool?

When working with HTML, especially in content management or web development, it can be tedious to manually add `mailto` links to email addresses every time. This tool speeds up the process and reduces the chance of errors, ensuring that all email addresses in your HTML are properly linked for user interaction.

### Who Can Benefit?

- **Web Developers**: Streamline your workflow by quickly generating `mailto` links without manually editing your code.
- **Content Creators**: Ensure that all email addresses in your content are correctly linked without needing to dive into HTML code.
- **Project Managers**: Use the tool to quickly validate and update email addresses in any HTML documentation or website content.
